# Medi-Glass-GUI
##Medical Glasses Concept 
#### I came up with an idea which would reduce the workload of nurses and doctors by wearing these virtual simulating glasses called the 'Medi-Glass'.
The glasses had 3 function capabilities: X-Ray, Medical, and Normal mode, as well as the usual On and Off switch. This was all done in Java on the Eclipse IDE.
